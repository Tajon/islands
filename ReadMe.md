My Flask assignment was to find the 20 most populated Caribbean nations and have them feature the nations current population and the percentage of the entire Caribbean that each nation holds. I had no problem getting the population from the website linked below. I found the percentage of the Caribbean by taking the live number that is updated and dividing it by each island respectfully. Then I converted them. My main problem with this assignment was figuring out how to connect the variables and make sure every variable  pointed to the correct function. After I was finally able to add the CSS I managed to get the colors on the page and the responsiveness up to par. However, I could not get the index page to have the exact same format as each island page.

The link where I found the population numbers was worldometers.info/world-population/caribbean-population/
